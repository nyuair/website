In addition to learning about the most effective machine learning techniques, you will gain the practical implementation of applying these techniques to real engineering problems.",prereq:"ENGR-UH 1000 (or CS-UH 1001) & ENGR-UH 3510 (or CS-UH 1050 & CS-UH 1052) & MATH-UH 1022 & ENGR-UH 2010Q (or MATH-UH 2011Q)",img:o},{coursenum:"ENGR-UH 4143",title:"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",desc:"This advanced course in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition is a focused offering within the expansive field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of both foundational and advanced topics in computer vision. Foundational topics include image representation, image pre-processing, edge detection, and image segmentation. The course also covers a range of advanced topics such as image registration, object detection, object tracking, and 3D scene understanding with semantic interpretation. A significant emphasis is placed on the integration of machine learning methods, particularly neural networks and deep learning, to solve complex visual interpretation tasks. Students will engage in hands-on projects that apply these cutting-edge algorithms to real-world engineering challenges. By the end of the course, students will not only be proficient in the most effective machine learning techniques but will also have gained invaluable practical experience in applying these techniques to solve engineering problems.",prereq:"ENGR-UH 3510 (or CS-UH 1050 and CS-UH 1052) and MATH-UH 1022 AND ENGR-UH 2010Q (or MATH-UH 2011Q)",img:c}];return e.jsxs("div",{className:"pub-body-all",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"container joinusbg height1vh",children:e.jsx("div",{className:"row",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"pubHeader",children:[e.jsx("h4",{children:"RESOURCES"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"headtextpub",children:"Education"}),e.jsxs("p",{className:"smallertexts",children:["Browse through our collection of educational resources, ",e.jsx("br",{})," and enhance your knowledge with our comprehensive materials and tools."]})]})})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"container displayrelup",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"row",children:[e.jsx("h2",{children:"Courses at NYUAD"}),i.map((n,s)=>e.jsx("div",{className:"pub-single-item coursesx",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"pub-holderflex",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"leftpubflex",children:e.jsx("img",{src:n.img,alt:"Course"})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"rightpubflex",children:[e.jsxs("p",{className:"pub-title",children:[n.coursenum,": ",n.title]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"pub-authors",children:n.desc}),e.jsx("p",{className:"pub-venue",children:e.jsxs("i",{children:[" ",e.jsx("b",{children:"Prerequisites:"})," ",n.prereq]})}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsxs("a",{href:n.download,className:"downloadPdf",children:[" ",e.jsxs("div",{children:[" ",e.jsx("span",{children:"Download Syllabus"}),e.jsx(t,{})," "]})]}),e.jsxs("a",{href:n.link,target:"_blank",className:"downloadPdf",children:[" ",e.jsx("span",{children:"Learn More"})," ",e.jsx(r,{})]})]})]})]})},s))]})})]})};export{p as default};
